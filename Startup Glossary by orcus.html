      { title: 'Stealth mode',description:"Stealth mode in a startup refers to a period of secrecy and confidentiality, where the company operates quietly, without publicly disclosing its existence, products, or services. This allows the startup to develop its ideas, protect its intellectual property, and gain a competitive advantage before officially launching and revealing its business to the public, investors, and potential competitors."},
      { title: 'Minimum Viable Product (MVP)',description:"A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in a startup is a simplified version of a product or service that has just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development. The MVP allows startups to test their assumptions, validate market demand, and iterate quickly without investing too much time or resources, ultimately reducing the risk of launching a product that may not meet customer needs."},
      { title: 'Outsourcing',description:"Outsourcing in a startup refers to the practice of contracting external companies or individuals to perform specific tasks, functions, or projects, rather than handling them in-house. This allows startups to access specialized skills, reduce costs, and increase efficiency, freeing up internal resources to focus on core business activities and drive growth."},
      { title: 'Piggybacking',description:"Piggybacking in a startup refers to the strategy of leveraging an existing product, service, or platform to launch or grow a new business.

      { title: 'pitch deck',description:"A pitch deck in a startup is a visual presentation that showcases the company's key elements, such as its mission, product, target market, business model, and growth potential.

      { title: 'pivot',description:"A pivot in a startup refers to a strategic shift in the company's business model, product, or direction in response to changes in the market, customer feedback, or new information. This involves adjusting or completely changing the startup's approach to better align with its goals, often requiring significant changes to the product, marketing, or sales strategy, but ultimately aiming to improve the startup's chances of success."},
      { title: 'Proof of concept (POC)',description:"A Proof of concept (POC) in a startup is a preliminary prototype or demonstration that tests the feasibility, viability, and potential of a product or service idea.

      { title: 'value proposition',description:"A value proposition in a startup is a clear and concise statement that explains the unique benefits, value, and solutions that the company's product or service offers to its target customers, highlighting what sets it apart from competitors and why customers should choose it over alternatives."},
      { title: 'Product roadmap',description:"A Product roadmap in a startup is a strategic plan that outlines the vision, goals, and timelines for the development and evolution of a product or service. It provides a high-level overview of the product's future direction, prioritizing features, and milestones, and serves as a guiding document for the product development team, stakeholders, and investors, ensuring everyone is aligned and working towards the same objectives."},
      { title: 'Software-as-a-service (SaaS)',description:"Software-as-a-service (SaaS) in a startup refers to a business model where software applications are hosted, managed, and delivered over the internet, rather than being installed on individual computers or servers. Customers access the software through a subscription-based model, providing startups with recurring revenue streams, lower distribution costs, and the ability to continuously update and improve their products."},
      { title: 'Scaling',description:"Scaling in a startup refers to the process of rapidly growing and expanding the business, while maintaining efficiency, profitability, and quality.

      { title: 'solopreneur',description:"A solopreneur is an individual who starts and runs a business alone, handling all aspects of the venture, from idea generation to execution, and often wearing multiple hats, such as founder, CEO, marketer, and developer. Solopreneurs typically rely on their own skills, resources, and network to drive growth and success, often leveraging technology and outsourcing to scale their business."},
      { title: 'Sprinting',description:"Sprinting in a startup refers to a short, focused period of intense work and development, typically 1-4 weeks, where a team works on a specific goal or project, such as building a prototype, testing a new feature, or resolving a critical issue. The goal of a sprint is to make rapid progress, iterate quickly, and deliver tangible results, often using agile methodologies and prioritizing tasks to maximize impact."},
      { title: 'Unicorpse',description:"A Unicorpse in a startup refers to a company that was once considered a unicorn, meaning it had reached a valuation of over $1 billion, but has since failed, gone bankrupt, or significantly declined in value. The term is used to describe the remnants of a once-promising startup that has not lived up to its initial expectations, often serving as a cautionary tale for entrepreneurs and investors."},
      { title: 'UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface)',description:"UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) in a startup refer to the process of designing and creating products that are intuitive, easy to use, and provide a seamless experience for customers. UX focuses on understanding user needs, behaviors, and motivations to craft an engaging and effective experience, while UI involves designing the visual elements, layout, and interactions that users interact with, aiming to create a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing product."},
      { title: 'Validation',description:"Validation in a startup refers to the process of testing and confirming assumptions about the business, product, or market, to ensure that the idea is viable and meets the needs of potential customers. This involves gathering feedback, data, and insights from potential customers, industry experts, and other stakeholders to validate the startup's value proposition, business model, and growth prospects, reducing the risk of launching a product or service that may not resonate with the target market."},
      { title: 'Wire framing',description:"Wire framing in a startup is a visual design process that involves creating low-fidelity sketches or digital diagrams to outline the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a product, website, or application. This helps to define the user interface, identify potential usability issues, and establish a clear visual direction before investing in more detailed design work."},
      {title:'Building in public',description:"Building in public in startups means transparently sharing the company's progress, successes, and failures with the public, often through social media, blogging, or live streaming. This approach helps build trust, credibility, and a community around the startup, allowing customers and users to provide feedback, suggest features, and feel invested in the company's success. By being open and vulnerable, startups can create a loyal following, generate buzz, and ultimately drive growth."},
      { title: 'Burn Rate', description: 'Burn rate is the speed at which a startup spends its available cash before becoming profitable. It includes salaries, office rent, software tools, marketing, and other business costs. Burn rate is usually measured monthly. For example, if a startup has $500,000 in the bank and spends $50,000 every month, its burn rate is $50,000, and its runway is 10 months. A high burn rate without enough revenue can be risky because it means the startup might need to urgently raise more money to avoid shutting down. Keeping a controlled burn rate is crucial for survival, especially in the early stages.' },
      { title: 'Cap Table (Capitalization Table)', description: 'A cap table is a detailed spreadsheet or chart that shows the ownership structure of a startup. It lists every shareholder — founders, investors, employees with stock options — and how much equity they own. It also includes details about preferred shares, options, warrants, and convertible notes. The cap table becomes more complex after each funding round. It’s essential for understanding how much control each party has, how much dilution has occurred, and what each investor’s stake is worth. Investors always review the cap table before investing because it shows how the company is structured.' },
      { title: 'Churn Rate', description: 'Churn rate measures the percentage of customers who stop using a company\'s product or service over a specific period, usually monthly or annually. For instance, if a SaaS company has 1,000 customers and 50 leave in a month, the churn rate is 5%. High churn means customers aren’t happy or don’t find enough value, which can kill a business, especially in subscription models. Reducing churn is critical because keeping an existing customer is much cheaper than finding a new one. Startups track churn carefully to improve their product, customer service, and retention strategies.' },
      { title: 'Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)', description: 'CAC is how much a startup spends, on average, to gain one new paying customer. It includes advertising, sales team salaries, software tools, and marketing campaigns. For example, if a company spends $10,000 on marketing and gets 100 customers, the CAC is $100. Keeping CAC low is important for profitability. If it costs more to acquire a customer than they will spend, the business will lose money. Startups try to optimize their marketing and sales funnels to reduce CAC and improve return on investment (ROI).' },
      { title: 'Customer Lifetime Value (CLV or LTV)', description: 'CLV or LTV is the total amount of money a customer is expected to bring into a company during their time as a customer. For example, if a customer pays $100 per month and stays for 10 months, their LTV is $1,000. High LTV shows that customers stick around and keep paying. Comparing LTV to CAC is vital — if LTV is much greater than CAC, the business can afford to invest more in growth. Increasing LTV can happen by improving customer loyalty, upselling, or offering additional services.' },
      { title: 'Crowdfunding', description: 'Crowdfunding is a method of raising money by getting small amounts of capital from a large number of people, usually via online platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or GoFundMe. It allows startups to fund their ideas without taking loans or giving away big chunks of equity. Sometimes, backers receive rewards like early access to products, while other times they receive equity or shares. Crowdfunding also tests market interest — if lots of people back the project, it’s a good sign the idea has real demand.' },
      { title: 'Deal Flow', description: 'Deal flow refers to the rate at which investment opportunities (startups, projects, etc.) are presented to investors. A venture capitalist (VC) or angel investor might see dozens or hundreds of startup pitches each month. A strong deal flow means having access to many high-quality startups to potentially invest in. It is often built through strong networks, reputation, startup events, or accelerators. Managing deal flow well is important because it allows investors to choose the best opportunities, compare different businesses, and diversify their investments. For startups, being part of a VC’s deal flow increases the chance of getting noticed and funded.' },
      { title: 'Down Round', description: 'A down round happens when a startup raises new funding but at a lower valuation than it had in a previous round. For example, if a startup was valued at $10 million in the last round but raises new money now at $7 million, that’s a down round. It usually means the company\'s performance didn’t meet expectations, or market conditions worsened. Down rounds can dilute early investors and founders more heavily, lower employee morale, and signal weakness to the market. However, they can also give the company a second chance to adjust its strategy and grow again.' },
      { title: 'Elevator Pitch', description: 'An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive summary about a business idea or startup that can be delivered in the time it takes to ride an elevator — about 30 to 60 seconds. It’s designed to quickly spark interest and make someone want to learn more. A great elevator pitch covers what the startup does, the problem it solves, and why it’s unique. Startups use elevator pitches at networking events, pitch competitions, or even casual conversations. The goal is to be clear, confident, and memorable — making someone say, "Tell me more."' },
      { title: 'Founder’s Agreement', description: 'A founder’s agreement is a legal document that outlines the rights, responsibilities, and expectations of each founder in a startup. It usually covers ownership percentages, roles (like CEO, CTO), how decisions are made, what happens if someone leaves, and how disputes will be handled. Having a founder’s agreement early prevents misunderstandings later, especially if tensions rise or the company becomes very valuable. It also often includes vesting schedules to make sure founders stay committed. Investors like to see clear agreements among founders before investing.' },
      { title: 'Funding Rounds (Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A, B, C...)', description: 'Startups raise money in stages, known as funding rounds. Pre-seed is the earliest, often funded by friends, family, or angels. Seed funding helps build the product and get early traction. Series A funding is for scaling the product and team. Series B and C are for expanding into bigger markets, acquisitions, or preparing for an IPO. Each round typically raises more money at a higher valuation if the startup is growing well. Understanding the funding stages helps startups plan their milestones and investors evaluate their readiness.' },
      { title: 'Growth Metrics', description: 'Growth metrics are key numbers that show how well a startup is expanding over time. Common metrics include user growth, monthly recurring revenue (MRR), customer retention rate, website traffic, and active users. These numbers help startups track progress and demonstrate traction to investors. High and healthy growth metrics make a company attractive for future funding rounds. Startups usually focus on a few core metrics depending on their business model (e.g., SaaS vs e-commerce). Good metrics tell the story of momentum and potential market leadership.' },
      { title: 'Intellectual Property (IP)', description: 'Intellectual Property (IP) includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets that legally protect original ideas, inventions, logos, designs, and creative works. For startups, owning valuable IP can create barriers for competitors, increase valuation, and attract investors. For example, a tech startup with patented technology has an advantage because competitors can’t legally copy their innovation. Protecting IP early is important because without it, ideas and inventions might get stolen or used without permission. Sometimes, startups’ biggest value lies in their IP portfolio itself.' },
      { title: 'Lead Investor', description: 'The lead investor is the main investor who takes the initiative in a funding round. They typically invest the largest amount, negotiate the key terms, help set the valuation, and bring credibility to the round. Other investors often follow the lead investor’s judgment, making it easier for startups to fill the round. Having a strong lead investor can also open doors to other networks, advisors, and future funding. Startups usually pitch to many investors but securing a respected lead is often the turning point for closing a successful round.' },
      { title: 'Lifetime Value to CAC Ratio (LTV:CAC)', description: 'This ratio compares how much money a customer brings to the company (LTV) to how much it costs to acquire them (CAC). A good LTV:CAC ratio is around 3:1 — meaning a customer is worth three times more than what it cost to get them. If LTV is lower than CAC, the company will lose money over time. A healthy ratio means that a startup has strong potential for scaling profitably. Startups watch this ratio closely to decide how much they can safely spend on marketing and sales without hurting margins.' },
      { title: 'Monetization Strategy', description: 'A monetization strategy is a startup’s plan for how it will make money. Different models include subscriptions (like Netflix), advertising (like Google), transaction fees (like PayPal), selling products (like Apple), or freemium models (like LinkedIn). Choosing the right strategy is crucial because it affects pricing, product design, and marketing. A clear monetization plan shows investors that the startup knows how it will generate revenue and eventually become profitable. Many startups start with gaining users first, but they always need a strong monetization strategy for long-term survival.' },

Many startups start with gaining users first, but they always need a strong monetization strategy for long-term survival.' },
      { title: 'Runway (Financial)', description: 'Runway is the amount of time a startup can continue operating before it runs out of money, based on its current spending. It’s usually measured in months. To calculate it, divide the total cash in the bank by the monthly burn rate. For example, if a startup has $300,000 and burns $30,000 per month, it has a 10-month runway. Knowing your runway helps founders plan when to raise more funds, cut costs, or speed up revenue growth. A short runway puts pressure on the team, while a long runway gives more flexibility to experiment and grow carefully.' },
      { title: 'SaaS Metrics (MRR, ARR)', description: 'In SaaS (Software as a Service) companies, two key metrics are Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). MRR is the predictable monthly income from subscriptions, while ARR is the yearly version (MRR × 12). These metrics show the stability and growth of a company’s revenue. Investors love SaaS models because recurring revenue is steady and easier to predict. Good MRR/ARR growth means that customers are consistently paying and the business is scaling well. Startups closely track churn rates, upsells, and new customer signups alongside MRR/ARR.' },
      { title: 'Secondary Sale', description: 'A secondary sale happens when early employees, founders, or early investors sell their shares to someone else before the company officially goes public (IPO) or gets acquired. It allows them to “cash out” some of their paper wealth. Secondary sales are common when a startup becomes very valuable but stays private for a long time. It gives liquidity to early participants without the company raising new money. However, too many secondary sales can worry investors if it looks like insiders are losing confidence.' },
      { title: 'Seed Capital', description: 'Seed capital is the first major funding a startup raises, after initial personal savings or support from family and friends. It’s used to build a minimum viable product (MVP), hire a small core team, run initial marketing campaigns, and find product-market fit. Seed funding often comes from angel investors, early-stage venture capital firms, or crowdfunding. It’s risky because the company is very young, but the potential rewards are huge if the startup succeeds. Investors at the seed stage usually receive equity in exchange for their money.' },
      { title: 'Syndicate (in investments)', description: 'A syndicate is when a group of investors pool their money together to invest in a startup. One lead investor usually organizes the deal, negotiates with the startup, and manages communication with the other members. Syndicates allow smaller investors to participate in deals they might not access on their own. Platforms like AngelList have made it easier to form syndicates online. For startups, syndicates can be a fast way to raise a larger amount of money without managing dozens of separate negotiations.' },
      { title: 'Term Sheet', description: 'A term sheet is a non-binding document that outlines the main terms and conditions of a potential investment. It includes things like how much money will be invested, the valuation of the company, the percentage of ownership offered, and investor rights. It acts like a roadmap for the final legal agreements. A good term sheet speeds up the negotiation and funding process. Founders should understand key terms — like liquidation preference or board control — because they affect future fundraising and company control.' },
      { title: 'Vesting Schedule', description: 'A vesting schedule defines when founders or employees actually earn their stock options or shares. For example, a 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff means no shares are earned until after one year, and then monthly after that. This motivates team members to stay long-term and work hard for the company’s success. If someone leaves early, they usually only keep the shares they’ve vested. Vesting is important to protect the company’s equity structure and show investors that key people are committed.' },
      { title: 'Viral Coefficient', description: 'The viral coefficient measures how quickly a product spreads through word-of-mouth or referrals. It shows how many new users each existing user brings. If 1 user invites 2 new users, the viral coefficient is 2. If it’s above 1, the product grows exponentially without heavy marketing spend. Products like Dropbox and WhatsApp used viral growth to scale quickly. A strong viral loop can massively reduce customer acquisition costs and boost growth. Startups design incentives like referral bonuses to increase their viral coefficient.' },
      { title: 'Sweat Equity', description: 'Sweat equity means contributing work, time, and effort to a startup instead of cash. Founders often earn their shares through sweat equity by building the product, finding customers, and running the company. It shows deep commitment — putting “skin in the game.” Sweat equity is crucial for early startups that can’t afford high salaries. Over time, this hard work can become incredibly valuable if the startup succeeds. Investors like to see founders with significant sweat equity because it signals dedication and belief in the business.' },
      { title: 'Angel Investor', description: 'An angel investor is a wealthy individual who invests their personal money into very early-stage startups. Angels often invest smaller amounts (like $25K–$250K) compared to venture capitalists. They usually invest based on the founder’s vision, team, and early traction rather than detailed financials. Angels not only provide capital but sometimes offer mentorship, connections, and industry expertise. Their support can be crucial in the risky, early days when traditional investors might say no. Famous angels include people like Ron Conway and Naval Ravikant.' }
